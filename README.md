# General-DataScience


## Overview

Minor Projects/Learnings under the broader topic of Data Science (done completely in Python)

Each folder is a completely new minor project, the complexity of which (possibly) increases as I dive deeper into
Data Science both at a personal level and also academically.

## Folder Contents

### readme file
Readme file explaining:
1. The data, its schematics, where it is from.
2. A deep overview into what all topics and concepts were touched as a part of the project.
3. Pre-requisites that you'll need installed in your machine in order to run the code.

### Data
Single/Multiple csv files containing all the data that was studied, done calculations on.
This also includes output files that might have been created as a part of few of the projects.

### code.py
All of the code that was written as a part of the several smaller projects.

### report.pdf
A report that goes in-depth for all of the projects exploring intricacies and also the place where views and thought
processes after reading and going through the results were written.
