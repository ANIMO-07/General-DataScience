# Autoregression


## The Data

The dataset used in this project is basic and quite simple in the terms that it gives the daily electricity power units
(in MegaWatts) in the state of Himachal Pradesh in the light of Covid19 and subsequent lockdown. The data is recorded in the 
form of a time series for a period of 17 months beginning from 2nd Jan 2019 till 23rd May 2020. The data is present in the
file "datasetA6_HP.csv" with the first column representing the date and the second column representing power consumed.
